    "# Vector Stores Tutorial\n",
    "A vector store is a data structure or database optimized for storing, managing, and retrieving high-dimensional vectors (numerical representations). These vectors typically come from embeddings generated by machine learning models, where the embedding represents the essence of a piece of data (e.g., text, image, or audio) in a dense numerical format.\n",
